#### Overview:

CinePiks is my first major project, designed to push my skills and challenge me as a developer. The goal was to create a platform where users can explore, track, and analyze movies and TV shows from multiple streaming servicesâ€”all in one place. This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience with frontend and backend development, authentication, state management, API integrations, and UI/UX design.

## Final Reflection

This project took me approximately four months to complete due to the learning curve I faced, especially in the beginning, and begin a Computer Science student. My goal was to challenge myself with an ambitious first real-world project that would push me to learn new concepts, work with modern technologies, and, most importantly, gain confidence as a developer.

My goal was to build a platform that allows users to:
- Explore the latest movies and TV shows across multiple streaming services.
- Compare what different streaming platforms offer without switching between multiple apps.
- Track their watchlist, mark watched content, and rate movies and series.

The biggest challenge I faced was Authentication using NextAuth and understanding and implementing Redux Toolkit for caching data and state managment, which resulted in a lot of reasearch and testing to make sure I was following the correct process. But I also faced multiple small challenges, including handling API responses, formatting data correctly, and ensuring smooth UI interactions. 

In conclusion, I chose Next.js for this project because I wanted to work with modern industry standards and build something scalable. I understand that my code may seem a mess from an expert's perspective, but I am incredibly proud of this achievement and eager to learn more.
