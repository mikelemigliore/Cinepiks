#### Overview:

CinePiks is my first major project, designed to push my skills and challenge me as a developer. The goal was to create a platform where users can explore, track, and analyze movies and TV shows from multiple streaming services—all in one place. This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience with frontend and backend development, authentication, state management, API integrations, and UI/UX design.

## Final Reflection

This project took me approximately 4month to complete dure to begina Computer cience student and the learning curve I faced and the goal was to have an ambitious project as my first real project that would challenge me and at the same time allow me to get familiar with various concepts and ttechnologies and especially gain some confidence.

Balancing university and development at the same time, I was able to complete this project in about four months. Throughout the process, I faced many ups and downs, but that’s exactly what made it such a valuable learning experience. I picked up new technologies along the way, learning and adapting as I went.

I know my code may not be perfect—it might even look like a mess to an experienced developer—but I’m proud of what I’ve built. More importantly, this project has reinforced my passion for learning and my drive to become a better, more efficient developer. CinePiks is just the beginning, and I’m excited for what comes next.
